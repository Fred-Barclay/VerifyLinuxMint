<a id="Welcome!" class="anchor" href="#welcome" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true"
	class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome!</h2>

<p>This guide is meant to be an easy to follow tutorial for verifying  the iso
images of Linux Mint 17, 17.1, 17.2, 17.3, 18, and LMDE 2.</p>

<h2>
<a id="ftf" class="anchor" href="#ftf" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true"
	class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>First things first; or, why verify?</h2>

<p>Many newcomers to Linux Mint (and even some old-timers) are confused when they hear they should verify
their iso image. "What do you mean?" they ask. "What's the point of verifying?"</p>

<p>The usual response is something like this, "Verifying the image lets
you know that no one has tampered with the downloaded iso, and keeps you safe."
While this is certainly true, it often confuses the poor chap who asked, and
he/she either installs Mint without verifying, or leaves Mint alone, assuming
that it takes a degree in computer science to use Linux.</p>

<p>Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. Mint is widely recommended
as the "newbie's Linux" due to its ease of use and user-friendliness. All sorts
of people use Linux Mint, from teenagers to people in their 90s - many of them
with no prior computer experience!</p>

<p> But in order to make sure that these people, and that you, have the best
experience possible with Linux Mint, the Mint developers recommend
that you verify your downloaded Linux Mint iso image <b>before</b> you install
Mint. The benefit of this is two-fold:
<br><b>(1).</b> Verifying shows that nothing went wrong with your download. I have personally
seen several cases in which users were having a lot of trouble with Linux Mint,
and it turned out they had installed an iso which had been damaged during download.
Had they verified Mint before installing, they would have noticed that the iso
was damaged and saved themselves a lot of time and frustration.</br>
<br><b>(2).</b> Today more than ever, cybercriminals want to control your computer and steal
your information. It is possible that such a criminal might hack into the Linux Mint website
and replace the good Linux Mint iso images with ones they have re-written to do
bad things. If you do not verify the Linux Mint iso you download, you will probably
not know if it is a good iso or an evil one. If the iso is in fact evil and you
install it (depending on what you do on your computer) you could give your
identity, bank account numbers, and other important information to these criminals.
If, on the other hand, you verify the Mint iso and see that it is not good, you
will know not to install it and can keep yourself safe.</br></p>

<p>In fact, something very similar happened in February 2016. An Eastern European
hacker compromised the Linux Mint website and redirected downloads of Linux Mint
17.3 Cinnamon 64-bit to his own server, which had malicious iso images. Thanks to
users who checked their iso images and noticed that something was wrong, this was discovered very quickly
and the problem fixed before much harm was done. Had the users not checked
their iso images, they and many other people could have been hurt.</p>

<p>I hope that this has convinced you of the importance of verifying your
downloaded copy of Linux Mint. In the next part of this guide, we'll look at
exactly what verification is.</p>

<h2>
<a id="whatis" class="anchor" href="#whatis" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true"
	class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is verifying?</h2>

<p><b>Verifying</b> is a term that is used in several different ways, but most
commonly it means to use a special program to ensure that the downloaded Mint iso
is in fact the correct one. This is a two-step process for Mint:</p>
<p>(a) Calculate the sha256sum of the iso, and compare it to the "good" one.
<br><small>A sha256sum is a type of "checksum", a mathematically-derived word or
"string" that can be used to check that a file is a perfect copy of another.</small>
</br>
<br>(b) Make sure that the sha256sum you are comparing yours to is correct by using GPG.
This is actually the coolest part of the entire process - sha256sums can be faked, but
but this step, if done properly, cannot be fooled!</br></p>

<p>In other words, checking the sha256sum shows that your download had no errors,
and checking the GPG signature verifies that you have a safe, untampered iso.</p>

<h2>
<a id="mainvrf" class="anchor" href="#mainvrf" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true"
	class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to verify</h2>
So let's get to it!
<br>Download the Mint iso, and the files <i>sha256sum.txt</i> and <i>sha256sums.txt.gpg</i>.
<p>Not sure where they are? Here's what you need to do:</p>

<p>Visit <a href="https://linuxmint.com/mirrors.php">this page</a> to see the list
of sites that host Mint isos and look for your nation's flag, or that of a nation near you, then click on
one of the links. For example, someone in the United States would look for the
American flag, and then perhaps choose <a href="http://mirrors.advancedhosters.com/linuxmint/isos/">
advancedhosters.com</a> or <a href="http://mirrors.seas.harvard.edu/linuxmint/">Havard
School of Engineering</a>.</p>
<p>A web page should open with (usually) three folders on it: "debian/", "stable/",
and "testing/". If you are downloading Mint 17.x or Mint 18, then choose "stable/"
and then select the folder with the version you want; if LMDE 2 then choose
"debian/". Next, download the iso image, sha256sum.txt, and sha256sum.txt.gpg,
all into the same folder (aka directory). For most users, this will automatically
be their Downloads folder.</p>

<p>For example, if I wanted to download Mint 17.3 Xfce 32-bit from
advancedhosters.com, I would go to that mirror as described above, and then choose
<i>stable/</i> and then <i>17.3/</i>. Here I can see the Linux Mint 17.3 iso images. I
would download <i>linuxmint-17.3-xfce-32bit.iso</i>, <i>sha256sum.txt</i>, and
<i>sha256sum.txt.gpg</i>.</p>

<p>Some browsers do not download <i>sha256sum.txt</i> and <i>sha256sum.txt.gpg</i>
automatically. Instead, they open the files in a new tab. If this occurs, press
Ctrl+S and you will be able to download each file.</p>

<p>The next steps depend on what operating system you are currently using: Windows,
OS X (Mac), or Linux.</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>
<p><i>Currently in progress...</i>

<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>Most Linux distros already have an sha256sum generator and a GPG client installed.
If yours doesn't, check online for instructions on how to install these.</p>

<p>Now open a terminal and <kbd>cd</kbd> into the directory that you downloaded the iso
and sha256 files. For example, if you saved them to your Downloads folder, then:
<br><kbd>cd ~/Downloads</kbd></br></p>

<p>Next, calculate the sha256sum of the Mint iso.
	<br><font color="3333CC"><kbd>sha256sum &ltmint-iso-file&gt</kbd></font></br>
Naturally, you should replace &ltmint-iso-file&gt with the correct name of the
iso file. This step may take a few minutes.</p>

<p>After you get the sha256sum, compare it to the corresponding one in the
<i>sha256sum.txt</i> file. For example, if I had downloaded linuxmint-17.3-xfce-32bit.iso,
sha256sum.txt tells me that the correct sha256sum is
<pre>cebff34e99b071d7237d2cfd2e24719f5a72e9e499a82d424007e850befc755b</pre> If
this is identical to the output of <kbd>sha256sum linuxmint-17.3-xfce-32bit.iso</kbd>,
then the download proceeded correctly and we can proceed to the next step.</p>

<p>If the sha256sum does not match, then your download had errors and you have a
damaged Linux Mint iso. Delete it and try again.</p>

<p>After the sha256sum is correct, we need to verify the file <i>sha256sum.txt</i>
to make sure it is from the Mint developers and not a malicious third party. Since
the Mint developers have provided a detached GPG signature, <i>sha256sum.txt.gpg</i>,
we will import their signing key and use it to verify the <i>sha256sum.txt</i> file
and, by extension, the Mint iso image.</i></p>

<p>But wait! There are actually two different keys used to sign Linux Mint <i>sha256sum.txt</i>
files, depending on the version. Specifically, Mint 18 uses a newer key, while
Mint 17.x and LMDE 2 use an older (but still good) key.
<br>If you have downloaded Mint 18 (it doesn't matter if it's Cinnamon, KDE, MATE,
or Xfce; or 32 or 64 bit), use the following command to import the public key:
<br><font color="3333CC"><kbd>gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key "27DE B156 44C6 B3CF 3BD7 D291 300F 846B A25B AE09"</kbd>
</font></br></br>
<br>If you have downloaded one of the Mint 17.x series, or LMDE 2, use the following
command in your terminal to import the public key:
<br><font color="3333CC"><kbd>gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key "E1A3 8B8F 1446 75D0 60EA 666F 3EE6 7F3D 0FF4 05B2"</kbd>
</font></br></br>

<p>Now let's verify! Enter the following command into your already-opened terminal:
<br><font color="3333CC"><kbd>gpg --verify sha256sum.txt.gpg sha256sum.txt</kbd></font></br></p>

<p>Hopefully, you'll see something like this (for Mint 18):
<br><pre>$ gpg --verify sha256sum.txt.gpg sha256sum.txt
gpg: Signature made Wed 07 Sep 2016 22:56:33 AEST using RSA key ID A25BAE09
gpg: Good signature from "Linux Mint ISO Signing Key <root@linuxmint.com>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 27DE B156 44C6 B3CF 3BD7  D291 300F 846B A25B AE09</pre><br>

or this (for Mint 17.x/LMDE 2):
<br><pre>$ gpg --verify sha256sum.txt.gpg sha256sum.txt
gpg: Signature made Wed 08 Apr 2015 00:19:15 AEST using DSA key ID 0FF405B2
gpg: Good signature from "Clement Lefebvre (Linux Mint Package Repository v1) &ltroot@linuxmint.com&gt"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: E1A3 8B8F 1446 75D0 60EA  666F 3EE6 7F3D 0FF4 05B2</pre></br>
</p>

<p>If you see this, then congratulations! You have successfully verified Linux
Mint! That wasn't too hard, was it? :-)</p>

<p>Don't worry about the "WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted
signature!" This only means that you have not signed the Mint key with your own
key (which you probably don't even have); it's not a message about the safety of
the Mint iso itself.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if something is wrong, you'll see something like this:
<pre>$ gpg --verify sha256sum.txt.gpg sha256sum.txt
gpg: Signature made Wed 06 Jan 2016 10:06:20 AM CST using DSA key ID 0FF405B2
gpg: BAD signature from "Clement Lefebvre (Linux Mint Package Repository v1) &ltroot@linuxmint.com&gt"
</pre>
See the line that says "BAD signature"? That's what we don't want. Delete and
re-download <i>sha256sum.txt</i> and <i>sha256sum.txt.gpg</i> and try again. If
it fails a second time, delete both Mint iso image and the two sha256sum files,
choose a different mirror, and work through this again.</p>
